## Project Title: Predictors of Coping with Alcohol-Use Expectation Violations

**Techniques Used:**
- Experimental within-subjects design
- Descriptive statistics
- One-way and two-way ANOVAs
- Vignette development
- Manipulation of independent variables

**Summary:**
I investigated how university students cope with expectation violations regarding alcohol use, focusing on valence, discrepancy magnitude, and controllability as predictors. I designed a 2x2x2 within-subjects online experiment and developed vignettes to simulate real-life expectation violations related to alcohol consumption. Responses were analyzed using one-way and two-way ANOVAs to identify coping strategies such as immunization, assimilation, and accommodation. This project shows my skills in experimental design, statistical analysis, and the development of detailed and realistic vignettes for research purposes.
